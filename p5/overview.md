## Basic concept description / goals ##

This Processing+JavaScript library starts with the original goal of Processing at it's beginning, to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach computer programming fundamentals within a visual context, and reimagines it for today, based on JavaScript instead of Java. The focus will first be on basic API and 2D drawing functionality, leaving more advanced graphics features, like shaders and 3D, for later.

- start with canvas, reveal

- something about syntax, API
